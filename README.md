# Custom Slack Bot

## Slack Config
Configure Apps > Custom Integrations > Bots > Add configuration
Give your bot a username

_note: I've seen a few methods to get to the Bots > New configuration screen so Slack instances may vary_


@botname to invite it to channel
/kick @botname to rm it (requires proper Slack permissions)





- make sure to mention the bot to invite it into your channel, else it has nobody to listen or talk to :(
